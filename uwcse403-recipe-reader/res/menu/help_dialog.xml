                android:text="Recipe Reader is an Android application for finding, viewing, and voice navigating recipes.

The app has 2 main parts or views. The 'Home' or 'Search' view and the 'Recipe' view.

The 'Home' view is the first view users see when the app opens. This view has 4 tabs; the main keyword search, advanced search, favorites, and settings.
	-The main keyword search allows users to search our database of recipes by keywords and displays results.
	-The advanced search shows categories and allows users to choose what kind of food they are looking to make and displays results accordingly.
	-The favorites tab shows the favorite recipes of the user currently logged in.
	-The settings tab allows users to log in or out of their account.

Search results in the 'Home' or 'Search' view are displayed as a list. Each item is shown with a picture for it's category, a favorite star, the name of the recipe, and the recipe's rating.
	-Clicking on the favorite start will add or remove the recipe from the current user's favorites list.
	-Clicking on the name of the recipe will open that recipe in the 'Recipe' view.

The 'Recipe' view shows the details of a recipe and allows the user to follow the recipe directions using their voice.
The first screen the user sees when they open a recipe in the 'Recipe' view shows a picture of the recipe and some overview information.
At the bottom on the screen there are 3 buttons. Start, Ingredients, and Instructions.
	-The Ingredients and Instructions buttons show the corresponding information without voice control. This is useful for browsing recipes or while shopping for supplies.
	-The Start button initiates the voice control feature.
		-All the instructions will be shown in a list.
		-The current step will always be highlighted.
		-The first step will be read to the user.
		-The user can user the 3 buttons at the top to navigate the recipe. (forward, backward, or repeat)
		-The user can also make a noise louder than the 'threshold' (see below under settings button) and a voice analyzer will appear.
			-the user can say any of these supported voice commands:
				-forward
				-back
				-repeat

Android Buttons:
	-The 'Back' button is used to move backward in the app. Such as: in the 'Recipe' view the back button can be used to return to search results.
	-The 'Settings' button has 2 different uses depending on the current view.
		-'Home' view: Shows these directions
		-'Recipe' view: Allows the user to set the 'threshold' for noise that activates the voice input.
